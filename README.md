# ETH RobotDynamics Lecture Summary/Examples/Libraries

A repository with summaries, examples and Matlab cheat-sheets for the Robot Dynamics lecture at ETH.

The original latex summary was downlaoded from this website: http://www.zumguy.com/ and extended from there on.

Parts:
# 1. Matlab Cheat-Sheets / Functions
Matlab functions used somewhere in the lecture exercises or generally usefull functions. 

# 2. Robot Dynamics Summary
An original latex summary was found at http://www.zumguy.com, and extended from there on. A [current pdf-build](https://github.com/luchspeter/ETHRobotDynamics/blob/master/Summary/Robot_Dynamics_HS19.pdf) should be in the "Summary" folder.

# 3. Robot Dynamics C# Library & Unity Examples
The exact theories covered in the first part of the RD lecture (Forward / Inverse Kinematics & trajectory control) have been implemented in C# stand-alone .NET CORE libraries, and are show-cased in a Unity project. As an example a (rather poorly) modelled FANUC Cr7 was used. The corresponding repository with further information can be found [here](https://github.com/luchspeter/RobotDynamicsLibrary "Robot Dynamics Library").
